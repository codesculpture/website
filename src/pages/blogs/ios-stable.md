# Announcing Code Push iOS 1.0 🥳

Shorebird Code Push allows you to update your Flutter app instantly over the air
and deploy fixes directly to end users' devices.

Shorebird's Android support has been production ready for nearly a year and has
been used by thousands of apps. Hundreds of early adopters have tried our iOS
support during alpha these last 7 months.

To make iOS possible we built a custom interpreter and compiler for Dart. This
allows you to patch the Dart code in your Flutter app while complying with
Apple's security requirements.

We're excited to announce that Code Push for Flutter is now stable for iOS!

iOS beta requires the latest version of Shorebird CLI (`1.0.0`) and the latest
stable version of Flutter (`3.19.5`).

- 🏎️ Apps run 5x faster after patching.
